### Nice to meet you!

Hi! I am Maria, and I am [multipotentialite](https://www.ted.com/talks/emilie_wapnick_why_some_of_us_don_t_have_one_true_calling?language=en).

I am NeuroMindfulness and Agile Coach, and I have a technical background in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. \
I practice yoga and meditation, I dance salsa, I run, I walk, I cook.

I've been contributing to FitAnalytics' Agile Transformation and Snap Inc. acquisition. I am currently working at Ebay Kleinanzeigen where I am helping 5+ teams going trough the Adevinta's acquisition and the current hyper growth phase, while preserving collaboration and culture. 

I've also launched eBay Kleinanzeigen's Mindfulness Community with the goal of integrating mindfulness tools in our employees everyday life, fostering well-being and productivity.

Currently based in Berlin.
