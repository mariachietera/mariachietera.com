### Hi, I am Maria

<!-- I started my professional life studying Computer Science at the University of Trento in Italy and completed my Master's Degree in Machine Learning at the University of Catalunya, Barcelona.

In 2016 I moved to Berlin, Germany, where I started working as Machine Learning Researcher, Software Engineer and Data Scientist.
It soon became clear to me that access to self-awareness, trust, and effective communication profoundly influenced the value and quality of the work shipped in organizations as well as the overall happiness of the people around me.
Since then, I have been on a journey to bring the power of coaching and mindfulness to organizations and individuals.

In 2022 my husband and I moved to London, where I started my 200h Yoga Education.
 -->

I am a Coach, a Trainer and a Mindfulness Teacher.  
I am a woman who walks with women towards conquering the life they want.  
I firmly believe that, with the right support, we can achieve anything we set our minds to.  
I am here to support you.

I have a Master of Science in Computer Science, am a Master NeuroMindfulness® Coach Practitioner, and am a professional Associate Certified Coach with the International Coaching Federation (ICF ACC).
