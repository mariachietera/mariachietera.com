As having effective meetings becomes highly relevant in the remote word where we work in, the Be SAFE & Certain model can be a guide to help us designing that can create a motivating, safe and rewarding workshop experience for our participants.

One we have this notions in mind, how can we design and host workshops that enables the best out of the attendees?  

###What is the Be SAFE & Certain model?

The Be SAFE & Certain model, offers key insights into human behaviour: why we are motivated or not; why we are reactive or overly emotional at times; and why we can be resistant or hesitant about some ideas or people.In other words, these five domains are so important to you that your brain treats them in the same way it treats survival issues.

The limbic system is an ancient part of our brain that has the job of keeping us safe. The limbic
system is always on, and by pushing us away from threats or towards rewards it unconsciously
but powerfully influences our behaviour and our choices.

To understand how your limbic system is driving us and our clients â€“ in its efforts to keep us safe - Be SAFE & Certain model
puts together the six social elements we move towards and away from. The achronim stands for BElonging, Status, Autonomy, Fairness, Expectations, CERTAINty. 

This model can help us understanding the social brain well enough to skillfully navigate it.
Keeping this in mind we can design workshops that minimise threats response (avoid pain) and maximize reward response (seek pleasure) and influence the experience our our paticipants for good.

Let's go through the six elements of the model one by one.

###Purpose

People may become disengaged and demotivated at work if they don't understand, or can't invest in, the "bigger picture."
for example connecting their personal goals to organizational targets using OKRs
- Make a compelling goal from the session 
- only required people should be in the room
- bigger picture

###Status

significance 'significance', value (as you said) - not job title or position
very important is in the working environment. 
- Explicitate status of each attendees, how they can contribute. Validate their status.
- Facilitators should make everybody feel their voice matter. Thanks for your comment:

###Certainty: ability to predict the future

also invites and welcomes 'Uncertainty' as adventure, discovery, learning and growth (we grow under volatility we build antifragile strength)

Humans struggle with change. 
- Share the start and end on time, agenda, topic and topic in advance for lowering trigger responses.
- Explain activities or tasks in advance as details as possible. 
Why-what they need-how many-quality-resources-how much time do you have. (CPQQRT)

###Autonomy: sense of control over events

The need to direct your own life and work. To be fully motivated, you must be able to control what you do, when you do it, and who you do it with.
autonomy, build trust, and improve innovation and creativity
Leader vs Micromanager/Overexplaining Facilitators. 
- co-creation workshop
- workshop agreement before starting
- Honor all previous experience and contributions.

###Relatedness: how safe we feel with other paople

connection, belonging and real Inclusion - with the whole organisation. community and its ecosystem (not just my own team or my own tribe)
Psychological safety, 
- ice breakers, expecially when people don't know each other as humans.
People to feel comfortable around each other. F.i. find sth you have in common with the person next to you or 2 truths and a lie.

###Fairness: how we percieve the exchange between people to be

becomes 'kindness', beyond a 'just exchange' or reciprocity.
remain unbiased. Agree as a group on the standards, not to let leaders to break the rules
how to to make decision making
