title: "SCARF based Workshops: how to enable reward-based decision making"
draft: true

As having effective meetings becomes highly relevant in the remote-working world where we work, the Be SAFE & Certain model can be a guide to help us design a motivating, safe and rewarding workshop experience for our participants.

How can we design and host workshops that enable the best out of the attendees?  

###What is the Be SAFE & Certain model?

The Be SAFE & Certain model offers critical insights into human behaviour:

- Why are we motivated or not?
- Why are we reactive or overly emotional sometimes?
- Why can we be resistant or hesitant about some ideas or people?

In other words, these five domains are so important to you that your brain treats them like it treats survival issues.

The limbic system is an ancient part of our brain that has the job of keeping us safe. The limbic system is always on, and by pushing us away from threats or towards rewards, it unconsciously
but powerfully influences our behaviour and our choices.

To understand how your limbic system is driving our clients and us in its efforts to keep us safe - Be SAFE & Certain model
puts together the six social elements we move towards and away from. The acronym stands for BElonging, Status, Autonomy, Fairness, Expectations, and CERTAINty. 

This model can help us understand the social brain well enough to navigate it skillfully.
Keeping this in mind, we can design workshops that minimize threats response (avoid pain), maximize reward response (seek pleasure), and influence the experience of our participants for good.

Let's go through the six elements of the model one by one.

###Belonging

Belonging was necessary for the early man when survival depended on other people and safety in numbers.
Today, in our business environment, it is still important; we strive to belong, fit in, and be liked and are afraid of being cast out. A sense of belonging will help a team work better together.
Fear of being kicked out of the tribe will keep people from voicing an unpopular opinion, offering an innovative â€“ but controversial - idea or sharing critical information, e.g., that a project is headed off track.

Here are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:

- make sure to start with the proper frame: ask one or more leaders to remember the why are we they here together, what they aim to achieve, why the work of today matters
- have ice breakers: especially if the people in the room don't know each other yet, propose an activity that allows them to share a bit of their personal life to show up with some vulnerability. This will improve psychological safety and trust.

###Status

Knowing one's place in the tribe created stability and strengthened the tribe.
When people feel relevant, unique and needed, they are more likely to be
positive, contribute and recognise others' contributions.
When individuals have an unfilled need for status, they may become self-focused, critical of others or "ego-driven."
Today, in our business environment, we all feel better when roles are established, when we know how the (formal and informal) structures work, who the boss is and what our relationship with her is.

Here are a few ideas for incorporating this knowledge into your workshop:

- At the beginning of the workshop, ask the attendees to introduce themself and name which expertise they are bringing into the room
- As the workshop host, you should help balance speaking time and make sure everybody feels free to contribute to the conversation. 'What are some important voices we haven't heard from yet?' 
- Make sure you show gratitude and validate each intervention

---

###Autonomy: sense of control over events

The need to direct your own life and work. To be fully motivated, you must be able to control what you do, when you do it, and who you do it with.
autonomy, build trust, and improve innovation and creativity
Leader vs Micromanager/Overexplaining Facilitators. 
- co-creation workshop
- workshop agreement before starting: how are we going ot take decisions?

---

###Fairness: how we percieve the exchange between people to be

becomes 'kindness', beyond a 'just exchange' or reciprocity.
remain unbiased. Agree as a group on the standards, not to let leaders to break the rules
how to to make decision making

---


###Expectations

Make clear which kind of participation/preparation is required
Clarify results expected
Humans struggle with change. 
- Share the start and end on time, agenda, topic and topic in advance for lowering trigger responses.
- Explain activities or tasks in advance as details as possible. 
Why-what they need-how many-quality-resources-how much time do you have. 

---

###Certainty: ability to predict the future

People may become disengaged and demotivated at work if they don't understand, or can't invest in, the "bigger picture."
for example connecting their personal goals to organizational targets using OKRs
- Make a compelling goal from the session 
- bigger picture

also invites and welcomes 'Uncertainty' as adventure, discovery, learning and growth (we grow under volatility we build antifragile strength)
+ curve of change: find certanty and normalize uncertainty

In big wokshops-ppl don't know each other in advance: limit uncertainty using formats that everyonce already know/keep activity simple
