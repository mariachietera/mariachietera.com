title: "Pink-SCARF based Workshops: how to enable brain-reward-based decision making"
draft: true

As a facilitator, how can we design and host workshops that make the best out of the attendees?  
In this article I link a very famous brain-based behavioural model with some good facilitation practices, in the attempt of helping us exploring how we can create a motivating, safe and rewarding workshop experience for our participants.


###What is Pink-SCARF?

Pink-SCARF is the merge of 2 scientifically based behavioural models. 

In 'Your Brain at Work', David Rock describes five domain of social experience that the brain treats as primary rewards or threats. 
In other words, these five domains are so important to you that your brain treats them in the same way it treats survival issues.
And because they are so important, each is a major driver for social behaviour. 
These five domains for a model which David calls the SCARF model, which stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness.

P of purpose from Pink as part of the definition of motivation: Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose.

These five domains of the ‘human social experience’ activate either the primary reward or the primary threat circuitry of the brain.
A brain-based model on how to lead and motivate people

Neuroscience model to minimise threats response (avoid pain) and maximize reward response (dopamine, seek pleasure).
David Rock, research to figure our why humans behave in a certain way.

###Purpose

- Make a compelling goal from the session 
- only required people should be in the room
- bigger picture

---

###Status

significance 'significance', value (as you said) - not job title or position
very important is in the working environment. 
- Explicitate status of each attendees, how they can contribute. Validate their status.
- Facilitators should make everybody feel their voice matter. Thanks for your comment:

###Certainty: ability to predict the future

also invites and welcomes 'Uncertainty' as adventure, discovery, learning and growth (we grow under volatility we build antifragile strength)

Humans struggle with change. 
- Share the start and end on time, agenda, topic and topic in advance for lowering trigger responses.
- Explain activities or tasks in advance as details as possible. 
Why-what they need-how many-quality-resources-how much time do you have. (CPQQRT)

###Autonomy: sense of control over events

Leader vs Micromanager/Overexplaining Facilitators. 
- co-creation workshop
- workshop agreement before starting
- Honor all previous experience and contributions.

---

###Relatedness: how safe we feel with other paople

connection, belonging and real Inclusion - with the whole organisation. community and its ecosystem (not just my own team or my own tribe)
Psychological safety, 
- ice breakers, expecially when people don't know each other as humans.
People to feel comfortable around each other. F.i. find sth you have in common with the person next to you or 2 truths and a lie.

---

###Fairness: how we percieve the exchange between people to be

becomes 'kindness', beyond a 'just exchange' or reciprocity.
remain unbiased. Agree as a group on the standards, not to let leaders to break the rules
how to to make decision making
