title: "SCARF based Workshops: how to enable reward-based decision making"
draft: true
---

How can we design and host workshops that make the best out of the attendees?  
In this article I link a scientific brain-based behavioural model with some good facilitation practices, 
in the attempt of providing guidance on how we can create a motivating, safe and rewarding workshop experience for our participants.

###What is the SCARF model?

In the paper 'SCARF: a brain-based model for collaborating with and influencing others', David Rock describes five domain of human social experience that activate either the ‘primary reward’or ‘primary threat’ circuitry (and associated networks) of the brain. 
In other words, these five domains are so important to you that your brain treats them in the same way it treats survival issues.
And because they are so important, each is a major driver for social behaviour. 
These five domains for a model which we'll call SCARF model, an acronym standing for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness.

This can feel kind of nerdy, why should we care? 
This model can help us understanding the social brain well enough to skillfully navigate it.
Keeping this in mind we can design workshops that minimise threats response (avoid pain) and maximize reward response (seek pleasure) and influence the experience our our paticipants for good.

Let's go through the letters of the model one by one.

###Purpose

People may become disengaged and demotivated at work if they don't understand, or can't invest in, the "bigger picture."
for example connecting their personal goals to organizational targets using OKRs
- Make a compelling goal from the session 
- only required people should be in the room
- bigger picture

###Status

significance 'significance', value (as you said) - not job title or position
very important is in the working environment. 
- Explicitate status of each attendees, how they can contribute. Validate their status.
- Facilitators should make everybody feel their voice matter. Thanks for your comment:

###Certainty: ability to predict the future

also invites and welcomes 'Uncertainty' as adventure, discovery, learning and growth (we grow under volatility we build antifragile strength)

Humans struggle with change. 
- Share the start and end on time, agenda, topic and topic in advance for lowering trigger responses.
- Explain activities or tasks in advance as details as possible. 
Why-what they need-how many-quality-resources-how much time do you have. (CPQQRT)

###Autonomy: sense of control over events

The need to direct your own life and work. To be fully motivated, you must be able to control what you do, when you do it, and who you do it with.
autonomy, build trust, and improve innovation and creativity
Leader vs Micromanager/Overexplaining Facilitators. 
- co-creation workshop
- workshop agreement before starting
- Honor all previous experience and contributions.

###Relatedness: how safe we feel with other paople

connection, belonging and real Inclusion - with the whole organisation. community and its ecosystem (not just my own team or my own tribe)
Psychological safety, 
- ice breakers, expecially when people don't know each other as humans.
People to feel comfortable around each other. F.i. find sth you have in common with the person next to you or 2 truths and a lie.

---

###Fairness: how we percieve the exchange between people to be

becomes 'kindness', beyond a 'just exchange' or reciprocity.
remain unbiased. Agree as a group on the standards, not to let leaders to break the rules
how to to make decision making
